The organizational structure of a company is a critical component of its success. It defines the hierarchy of authority, responsibility, and communication within the organization. The organizational structure also determines how employees are grouped together and how they interact with one another. Understanding the organizational structure is essential for employees to know their roles and responsibilities and how they fit into the larger organization.

The organizational structure typically consists of several key elements:

- **Organizational Chart**: A visual representation of the company's hierarchy, showing the relationships between different departments, teams, and positions.
- **Departments**: Functional areas within the organization that are responsible for specific tasks or functions, such as General Affair, Quality, Engineering, and Operations.
- **Division**: Subunits within departments that focus on specific products, services, or markets such as HR, IT, Warehouse, Quality Control, and Manufacturing Engineering.
- **Positions**: Individual roles within the organization that have specific responsibilities and reporting relationships such as Operator, Line Leader, Specialist, Technician, Engineer, Manager and Director.
